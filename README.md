Welcome to the Splash MVC framework
===================================

What is Splash?
---------------

Splash is a MVC PHP framework. It is making a heavy use of annotations, and of [the Mouf dependency injection framework](http://www.mouf-php.com).
You might want to use Splash in order to seperate cleanly the controllers (that perform the actions required when you navigate your web application) and the view (that generates and displays the HTML that makes your web pages).
