Welcome to the Splash MVC framework
===================================

WORK IN PROGRESS
================

Splash 7 will be the first release to support PSR-7. It is currently in development. Meanwhile, the latest stable release
 you should use is Splash 5.1.

What is Splash?
---------------

Splash is a MVC PHP framework. It is making a heavy use of annotations, and of [the Mouf dependency injection framework](http://www.mouf-php.com).
You might want to use Splash in order to seperate cleanly the controllers (that perform the actions required when you navigate your web application) and the view (that generates and displays the HTML that makes your web pages).
